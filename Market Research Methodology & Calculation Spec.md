### 1. Market Size Calculations

#### How Values Were Calculated:
**Match-3 Market Size ($10.2B):**
- **Source**: Web search aggregating multiple industry reports (Sensor Tower, Statista, Business of Apps)
- **Calculation Method**: Cross-referenced 3+ sources reporting "Match with USD 10.2 billion" as third-largest mobile game genre
- **Validation**: Confirmed against "puzzle games $10B" and "match-3 subset of puzzle" data points
- **Time Period**: 2024 annual revenue (IAP + Ad revenue combined)

**Detective Games Market ($5B → $10.2B by 2030):**
- **Source**: Market research reports found via web search
- **Calculation Method**: "Global Role Playing Detective Game market projected to grow from US$ 5015 million in 2024 to US$ 10220 million by 2030"
