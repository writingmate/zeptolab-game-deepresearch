# Genre Deep-Dive

## Step 1 - Scan the market

1. **Data scrape the store**
   a. Pull top-20 games in the genre by absolute revenue/installs, revenue/installs growth

2. **Play & record**
   a. Each team member plays 3–4 reference titles and records a 30-minute session (video + notes)

3. **Deep research**
   a. PO and GD should play and deconstruct 1-2 top games in the genre extensively, preferably with some in-apps to fully understand the core loop

4. **Feature matrix**
   a. Build a shared sheet listing: core controls, FTUE length, meta layers, live-ops cadence, ad formats, main pay points

5. **Benchmarks (?)**
   a. Grab public KPI ranges from GameRefinery trend reports (D1, D7, ARPDAU)

Tag every feature "Must-have / Nice-to-have / Optional". Only the first column (prioritised) might go into the prototype.

## Step 2 - Player's voices

Learn what players love/ hate. Use Youtube, Reddit, and store reviews as inputs, log repeated pains and important points.

## Step 3 - Outside context

Find a few GDC/ Naavik/ Game Makers/ Deconstructor of Fun articles on the genre, log and summarise learnings.

## Step 4 - Hypothesis

Clearly state how we can win in this genre. It shouldn't be groundbreakingly new, a small but necessary and clever improvement in the very core loop might be enough.

## Step 5 - Prototype ideas

Each team member pitches 1-2 1-page concepts. Filter - fits Must-have features from the first step, reasonable effort to develop. Choose 1-2 for the next step.

## Step 6 - Grey box prototype

Let's take roguelike deckbuilder (like Balatro) as an example:

1. Identify the core verb ("play card, trigger combo").

2. Prototype that verb in engine with grey boxes/ simple visuals only (use AI); simple UI, no meta.

3. Internal playtest: is the loop already sticky for 10 min? If not, iterate 1–2 more days before adding anything else.

## What to watch inside any genre

| Layer | Why it matters | Evaluation |
|-------|----------------|------------|
| Core moment-to-moment fun | Drives D0 retention | "10-min rule": will a new player stay 10 min with grey boxes? |
| Progression & meta | Extends lifetime (D7/D30) | Map the first 60 min flow in competitor games; copy the pacing |
| Monetization triggers | Obvious | List the first 3 pay moments; do they appear before minute 30 (depends on genre)? |
| Live-ops cadence | Retains whales & boosts ARPDAU | Check how often reference games push events/sales (?) |
| Content cost per minute | Small-team sustainability | Estimate dev hours per playable minute |
