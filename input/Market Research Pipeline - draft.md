# Market Research Pipeline - draft

## 1. Genre deconstruction

**Who:** RnD Team Game Designer (currently FindLab)

**What to do:**

1. Use Sensor Tower or AppMagic to examine the top 50-100 grossing games for the selected genre using available market analysis lenses.

2. Export the data to a csv/excel file. For each game, tick boxes on the sheet: meta features, theme, art style, how they make money, how often they run events, etc.

3. When all games are tagged, compare common traits (e.g. '70% of games use decor meta').
   - Use the data to spot outliers (e.g. games with high ARPU but low installs or vice-versa, a fresh high earning theme/setting, etc.).
   - Can potentially use chatgpt to automate this step as well as tools like AppMagic's Top Trending for additional insights.

4. Cross-check findings with publicly available reports (from Newzoo, AppMagic, Sensor Tower, etc.).

## 2. Market sizing

**Who:**
- RnD Team Game Designer (currently FindLab)
- Marketing team
- Analytics team

**What to do:**

1. Using store reviews, FB, Discord chats and publicly available reports to sketch player personas (age, gender, interests).
   - Sensor Tower is working on the Audience Insights tool that can potentially automate most of this stuff. Access to it is restricted atm.

2. For each persona, estimate how many players exist in US/Tier-1 West countries and the average CPI to reach them.

## 3. Building the hypothesis list

**Who:**
- RnD Team Game Designer (currently FindLab)
- Marketing team
- Analytics team

**What to do:**

1. Take the gaps in the market that were identified in previous steps and turn them into high-level ideas. E.g. an animal rescue merge game.

2. Log every idea in a 'Hypotheses' tab of the spreadsheet with a quick note about the data that inspired it.

## 4. Creating a scorecard

**Who:** RnD Team Game Designer (currently FindLab)

**What to do:**

1. For each hypothesis, fill in the scorecard:
   - Market size (large / medium / small)
   - Competition gap (few rivals = high score)
   - Estimated CPI (low / medium / high)
   - Development difficulty (easy / moderate / hard for us to build)

2. Let the sheet total the points. Consider and discuss five best-scoring ideas.

## 5. Generating a concept brief

**Who:**
- RnD Team Game Designer (currently FindLab)
- Vasilii Tedeev

**What to do:**

1. For each selected idea, we should pick a live game that is most similar.

2. Play it and record what's good (keep) and what you'd improve, keeping in mind our 80/20 rule for proven/innovative features.

3. Create a concept brief outlining:
   - Target player persona
   - High-level description of the hypothesis/game idea
   - Key ways it beats the reference title

4. Check with Tech, Art and Marketing leads regarding idea feasibility (Can we build this into a full-fledged game and scale it? How long and how much will it take?).
   - This step can be potentially skipped at such an early stage.

5. Hand off the concept brief to RnD teams to be developed into game proposals and added to the concept backlog.
